## 📥 Downloading
1. Open your server’s URL in a browser: `http://[YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS]/index.php`.
2. Enter the YouTube playlist URL in the textbox and click **Download**.

> The download process will begin, with each video in the playlist converted to an MP3 file on your browser.  
> A progress bar will indicate the download status for each playlist item.

⚠️ **Important**: When prompted, make sure to allow "multiple downloads" for pop-ups.  
Once all downloads are complete, the script will display **"All Files Downloaded"** and the progress bar will reach 100%.
